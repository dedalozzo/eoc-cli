EOCSvr - A complete CouchDB Query Server written in PHP
=======================================================
EOCSvr stands for ElephantOnCouch Server. EOCSvr is a CouchDB's Query Server implementation made in PHP programming language.
CouchDB delegates computation of views, shows, filters, etc. to external query servers. It communicates with them over
standard input/output, using a very simple, line-based protocol. CouchDB launches the query server and starts sending commands.
The server responds according to its evaluation of the commands.
The default query server is written in JavaScript. You can use other languages by setting a MIME type in the language
property of a design document or the Content-Type header of a temporary view. Design documents that do not specify a language
property are assumed to be of type JavaScript, as are ad-hoc queries that are POSTed to temporary view without a Content-Type header.
Using EOCSvr you can finally write your views, updates, filters, shows directly in PHP. No more JavaScript, just pure PHP.


Composer Installation
---------------------

To install EOCSvr, you first need to install [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), a Package Manager for PHP, following those few [steps](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix):

``` sh
curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

You can run this command to easily access composer from anywhere on your system:

``` sh
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

EOCSvr Installation
-------------------
Once you have installed Composer, it's easy install OECSvr.

1. Move into the directory where is located `main.js` file:
``` sh
cd /opt/local/share/couchdb/server
```
If you are using MacPorts on Mac OS X, you can find it on `/opt/local/share/couchdb/server`, instead if you installed CouchDB from source you'll probably find it `/usr/share/couchdb/server/`. Please refer to the CouchDB installation [instructions](http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Installation).

2. Create a project for EOCSvr:
``` sh
sudo composer create-project 3f/eocsvr
```

CouchDB Configuration
----------------------------------
You are finally ready to configure CouchDB to use EOCSvr. At this point you just need to edit `local.ini` configuration file:

``` sh
vim /opt/local/etc/couchdb/local.ini
```

Then, under the `[query_servers]` section, add the following line:
``` sh
[query_servers]
php=/opt/local/share/couchdb/server/eocsvr/eocsvr.php
```


Usage
-----
To benefit of EOCSvr you must use [ElephantOnCouch](https://github.com/dedalozzo/ElephantOnCouch), a PHP client for CouchDB.
Using [ElephantOnCouch](https://github.com/dedalozzo/ElephantOnCouch) you can interact with CouchDB, and you can write your views directly in PHP.
You don't need to know about CouchDB internals, neither JSON, just learn [ElephantOnCouch](https://github.com/dedalozzo/ElephantOnCouch) and use it.
All you need is to learn the MapReduce concept and an high level guide on CouchDB.


Requirements
------------
PHP 5.4.7 or above.
